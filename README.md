# ðŸŽ® Wispy+
**Concept:** Wispy+ is a fork of Wispy, a Minecraft-like 2D game entirely made in Java.

The initial software has been released as a part of a series on this YouTube channel, [Aywen](https://www.youtube.com/@aywenvideos). In the series, Aywen explores and tests the programs he coded during his childhood. You can join his [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QjWsuaM3aB)

## The Fork

The goal of this fork is to keep the initial concept and technical choices of the project (Java 8, Java2D/Swing, etc.) while improving the code quality and adding new features.
